## ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY CREATION

### THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING
- What is received: Some subtle input or instructions by the user to take into account, but use as a foundation; it should not constrain creative freedom.
- What is created: An algorithmic philosophy/generative aesthetic movement.
- What happens next: The same version receives the philosophy and EXPRESSES IT IN CODE - creating p5.js sketches that are 90% algorithmic generation, 10% essential parameters.

Consider this approach:
- Write a manifesto for a generative art movement
- The next phase involves writing the algorithm that brings it to life

The philosophy must emphasize: Algorithmic expression. Emergent behavior. Computational beauty. Seeded variation.

### HOW TO GENERATE AN ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY
**Name the movement** (1-2 words): "Organic Turbulence" / "Quantum Harmonics" / "Emergent Stillness"

**Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs - concise but complete):

To capture the ALGORITHMIC essence, express how this philosophy manifests through:
- Computational processes and mathematical relationships?
- Noise functions and randomness patterns?
- Particle behaviors and field dynamics?
- Temporal evolution and system states?
- Parametric variation and emergent complexity?

**CRITICAL GUIDELINES:**
- **Avoid redundancy**: Each algorithmic aspect should be mentioned once. Avoid repeating concepts about noise theory, particle dynamics, or mathematical principles unless adding new depth.
- **Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY**: The philosophy MUST stress multiple times that the final algorithm should appear as though it took countless hours to develop, was refined with care, and comes from someone at the absolute top of their field. This framing is essential - repeat phrases like "meticulously crafted algorithm," "the product of deep computational expertise," "painstaking optimization," "master-level implementation."
- **Leave creative space**: Be specific about the algorithmic direction, but concise enough that the next Claude has room to make interpretive implementation choices at an extremely high level of craftsmanship.

The philosophy must guide the next version to express ideas ALGORITHMICALLY, not through static images. Beauty lives in the process, not the final frame.

## P5.JS IMPLEMENTATION

### ⚠️ STEP 0: READ THE TEMPLATE FIRST ⚠️
**CRITICAL: BEFORE writing any HTML:**
*(Note: Template file missing in this import, please ensure you use a valid p5.js boilerplate)*

1. **Read** `templates/viewer.html` (if available)
2. **Study** the exact structure, styling, and branding
3. **Use that file as the LITERAL STARTING POINT**
4. **Keep all FIXED sections exactly as shown**
5. **Replace only the VARIABLE sections**

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
**Seeded Randomness (Art Blocks Pattern)**:
```javascript
// ALWAYS use a seed for reproducibility
let seed = 12345; // or hash from user input
randomSeed(seed);
noiseSeed(seed);
```

**Parameter Structure - FOLLOW THE PHILOSOPHY**:
```javascript
let params = {
  seed: 12345,  // Always include seed for reproducibility
  // colors
  // Add parameters that control YOUR algorithm:
  // - Quantities (how many?)
  // - Scales (how big? how fast?)
  // - Probabilities (how likely?)
  // - Ratios (what proportions?)
  // - Angles (what direction?)
  // - Thresholds (when does behavior change?)
};
```

**Core Algorithm - EXPRESS THE PHILOSOPHY**:
**CRITICAL**: The algorithmic philosophy should dictate what to build.
Avoid thinking "which pattern should I use?" and instead think "how to express this philosophy through code?"

**Canvas Setup**: Standard p5.js structure:
```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(1200, 1200);
  // Initialize your system
}

function draw() {
  // Your generative algorithm
  // Can be static (noLoop) or animated
}
```

### CRAFTSMANSHIP REQUIREMENTS
**CRITICAL**: To achieve mastery, create algorithms that feel like they emerged through countless iterations by a master generative artist. Tune every parameter carefully. Ensure every pattern emerges with purpose. This is NOT random noise - this is CONTROLLED CHAOS refined through deep expertise.

- **Balance**: Complexity without visual noise, order without rigidity
- **Color Harmony**: Thoughtful palettes, not random RGB values
- **Composition**: Even in randomness, maintain visual hierarchy and flow
- **Performance**: Smooth execution, optimized for real-time if animated
- **Reproducibility**: Same seed ALWAYS produces identical output
